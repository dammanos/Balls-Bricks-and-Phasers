# Z01 Submission Plan — Neon Odyssey

## Objective
Deliver the strongest possible jam submission: stable, polished, and memorable.

## Core Priorities
1. Gameplay feel and stability
2. Clear controls and onboarding
3. Strong audiovisual identity
4. Submission page clarity

## Submission Focus
- Keep page messaging centered on experience and craftsmanship
- Highlight combo depth, temple variety, and powerup strategy
- Encourage play, feedback, and clip sharing

## 7-Day Improvement Loop (optional)
- Day 1–2: bug fixes from player feedback
- Day 3–4: readability/UI tweaks
- Day 5–6: polish pass (timing, effects, transitions)
- Day 7: final cleanup + updated screenshots/GIF

## Quality Metrics to Track
- Session completion depth (how far players get)
- Frequency of combo usage (are mechanics understood)
- Player comments mentioning feel/clarity
- Stability issues reported

## Decision Rule
Any post-jam direction is decided after submission feedback is collected.
